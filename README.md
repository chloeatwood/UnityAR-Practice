A basic mobile AR app that can be installed onto someone's phone to run. Created with Unity and Vuforia.

You play as a mouse and run around a living room in order to collect cheese.

To use you must print out the Cheese image located in the Cheese Image folder. When you open the app after installing it on your phone you must first scan the image then the scene will pop up.
